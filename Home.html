              Royal Enfield is an Indian multinational motorcycle manufacturing company, headquartered in Chennai. 
              The Royal Enfield brand, including its original English heritage, is the oldest global motorcycle brand in continuous production.
              The company operates manufacturing plants in Chennai in India.
              The first Royal Enfield motorcycle was built in 1901 by The Enfield Cycle Company of Redditch, Worcestershire, England, which was responsible for the design and original production of the Royal Enfield Bullet, the longest-lived motorcycle design in history.
              Licensed from the original English Royal Enfield by the indigenous Indian Madras Motors, the company is now a subsidiary of Eicher Motors, an Indian automaker.
              The company makes classic-looking motorcycles including the Royal Enfield Bullet, Classic 350, Royal Enfield Thunderbird, Meteor 350, Classic 500, Interceptor 650, Continental, Hunter 350 and many more. Royal Enfield also makes adventurous and offroading motorcycles like the Royal Enfield Himalayan. 
              Their motorcycles are equipped with single-cylinder and twin-cylinder engines.

              A motorcycle (motorbike, bike, or, if three-wheeled, a trike) is a two or three-wheeled motor vehicle steered by a handlebar from a saddle-style seat.
              Motorcycle designs vary greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long-distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport (including racing), and off-road riding. 
              Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and being involved in other related social activities such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies.
              The 1885 Daimler Reitwagen made by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Germany was the first internal combustion, petroleum-fueled motorcycle. 
              In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfm√ºller became the first series production motorcycle.
              Globally, motorcycles are comparable numerically to cars as a method of transport: in 2021, approximately 58.6 million new motorcycles were sold around the world, while 66.7 million cars were sold over the same period.

              A scooter (motor scooter) is a motorcycle with an underbone or step-through frame, a seat, a transmission that shifts without the operator having to operate a clutch lever, a platform for their feet, and with a method of operation that emphasizes comfort and fuel economy. 
              Elements of scooter design were present in some of the earliest motorcycles, and motor scooters have been made since at least 1914. 
              More recently, scooters have evolved to include scooters exceeding 250cc classified as Maxi-scooters.
              1919 Autoped Scooter
              The global popularity of motor scooters dates from the post-World War II introductions of the Vespa and Lambretta models in Italy. 
              These scooters were intended to provide economical personal transportation (engines from 50 to 150 cc or 3.1 to 9.2 cu in). 
              The original layout is still widely used in this application. Maxi-scooters, with larger engines from 200 to 850 cc (12 to 52 cu in) have been developed for Western markets.

              An electric vehicle (EV) is a vehicle that uses one or more electric motors for propulsion. 
              The vehicle can be powered by a collector system, with electricity from extravehicular sources, or can be powered autonomously by a battery or by converting fuel to electricity using a generator or fuel cells.
              EVs include road and rail vehicles, electric boats and underwater vessels, electric aircraft and electric spacecraft.
              Early electric vehicles first came into existence in the late 19th century, when the Second Industrial Revolution brought forth electrification. 
              Using electricity was among the preferred methods for motor vehicle propulsion as it provides a level of quietness, comfort and ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline engine cars of the time, but range anxiety due to the limited energy storage offered by contemporary battery technologies hindered any mass adoption of private electric vehicles throughout the 20th century. 
              Internal combustion engines (both gasoline and diesel engines) were the dominant propulsion mechanisms for cars and trucks for about 100 years, but electricity-powered locomotion remained 
              commonplace in other vehicle types, such as overhead line-powered mass transit vehicles
              like electric trains, trams, monorails and trolley buses, as well as various small, low-speed, short-range battery-powered personal vehicles such as mobility scooters.
