                    <center>It is essential that a vehicle have a source of energy to drive it. Energy can be extracted from external sources, as in the cases of a sailboat, a solar-powered car, or an electric streetcar that uses overhead lines. 
                        Energy can also be stored, provided it can be converted on demand and the storing medium's energy density and power density are sufficient to meet the vehicle's needs.
                        Human power is a simple source of energy that requires nothing more than humans. Despite the fact that humans cannot exceed 500 W (0.67 hp) for meaningful amounts of time,the land speed record for human-powered vehicles (unpaced) is 133 km/h (83 mph), as of 2009 on a recumbent bicycle.
                        The energy source used to power vehicles is fuel. External combustion engines can use almost anything that burns as fuel, whilst internal combustion engines and rocket engines are designed to burn a specific fuel, typically gasoline, diesel or ethanol. 
                        Food is the fuel used to power non-motor vehicles such as cycles, rickshaws and other pedestrian-controlled vehicles.
                        Another common medium for storing energy is batteries, which have the advantages of being responsive, useful in a wide range of power levels, environmentally friendly, efficient, simple to install, and easy to maintain. 
                        Batteries also facilitate the use of electric motors, which have their own advantages. 
                        On the other hand, batteries have low energy densities, short service life, poor performance at extreme temperatures, long charging times, and difficulties with disposal (although they can usually be recycled). 
                        Like fuel, batteries store chemical energy and can cause burns and poisoning in event of an accident.
                        Batteries also lose effectiveness with time.[43] The issue of charge time can be resolved by swapping discharged batteries with charged ones;
                        however, this incurs additional hardware costs and may be impractical for larger batteries. Moreover, there must be standard batteries for battery swapping to work at a gas station. 
                        Fuel cells are similar to batteries in that they convert from chemical to electrical energy, but have their own advantages and disadvantages.

                        There are over 1 billion bicycles in use worldwide.
                        In 2002 there were an estimated 590 million cars and 205 million motorcycles in service in the world.
                        At least 500 million Chinese Flying Pigeon bicycles have been made, more than any other single model of vehicle.
                        The most-produced model of motor vehicle is the Honda Super Cub motorcycle, having sold 60 million units in 2008.
                        The most-produced car model is the Toyota Corolla, with at least 35 million made by 2010.
                        The most common fixed-wing airplane is the Cessna 172, with about 44,000 having been made as of 2017.
